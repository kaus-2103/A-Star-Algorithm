On holiday, a flight  currently wants to travel to Bucharest from Arad. But there is no direct way to Bucharest from Arad. However, the cities are connected with each other like a graph. The distance between the connected cities are given. The flight wants to travel through the most optimal way. To find the optimal path to travel, another information is provided: the straight line distance between any city and the final destination (Bucharest). 
Now apply A* search to determine the most optimal value for the route Arad to Bucharest and help the flight. You have to use the straight line distance as the heuristic value for the cities.
